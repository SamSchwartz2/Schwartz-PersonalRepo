This is the repo for the final project for my C++ Object Oriented Programming Class from Spring 2022 Semester. 

The Lab5.sln file can be ran from a terminal and you can use commands (code for them found in either the Lab5 or Shared Code folder) 

The overall project works to mimic a basic command prompt similar to the Linux OS
