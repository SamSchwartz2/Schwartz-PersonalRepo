This folder contains the NetLogo file that is me and my partner Katie's final project for my Modeling Cultural Systems Class. 

The project is a combination of a Hotelling Line model and an adversarial game theoretic tournament (ala Axelrod's) using various strategies meant to model single elimination tournaments over a finite sample space - specifically, this project models American presidential primaries.

Attached is also our final paper, which gives background of the model and analysis of running the model.
