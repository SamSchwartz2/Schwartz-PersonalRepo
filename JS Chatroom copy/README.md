Creative: For the creative portion of this project, we implemented the following features:
      1) Added a disconnect button that allows users to disconnect from the server without needing to reload/exit out of the page
      2) Added a button that allows users to show and hide the current users in the room
      3) Added a feature that broadcasts to all users when a user unsuccessfully tries to enter a private room for security purposes

Grade: 48/50
-2pts send private message only worked about half of the time
